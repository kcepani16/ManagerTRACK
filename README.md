**Welcome To Our Project**

This project consists of giving an idea and providing a solution to minimize cost and time for big construction companies, such as “Salillari Co”, which gives earth-moving heavy equipment for construction purposes. 
* By creating a software in which we are going to analyze every economic and programming detail, we tend to achieve a successful project to be used by the company as the most efficient way to handle their business affair for the rent of the earth-
moving heavy equipment for construction.
* The project is going to provide every economic information needed, that said the project is going to include the number of workers in the company, the cost of every equipment that the company has, the daily price for the equipments and also the packet price for
renting them.
* In the project we are thinking to add also a register, in which every data about the small
companies that rent equipment from our company is provided. That is going to minimize time because a
company that has rented before does not have to lose time giving information when they want to rent
again from us.
* In order to see inside the machineries and matierals they will have to sign up as guests and after that they will be able to view the information about what they want to rent icluding the cost and everything else that they need to know.
